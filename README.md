# IKFRAM-React

Introductory project at the React library for the IKFRAM Module at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden.

In this project, I delved into the React library as part of the IKFRAM Module at the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. My primary objective was to gain hands-on experience with React and understand its application in developing interactive web interfaces.
